# Vulcan
Hello there. This is Vulcan. It's my attempt at building from scratch a coherent Agent Based Model to simulate a realistic macroeconomy in C++. I did this as my final year project at MEng Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London. 

The observant among you may point out that this does not have much to do with Mechanical Engineering. And well, I have no comments on that.

I finished the first version of this project in June 2023. I had to stop work at some point to deliver a report on the project and graduate, so it's not quite where I want it to be yet. I'm going to be regularly updating to make it much better.
